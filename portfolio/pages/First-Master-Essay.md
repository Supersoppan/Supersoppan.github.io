# Geographical distribution of the Swedish gasoline tax
## A panel estimation of price elasticities and consumer surplus loss using cointegration techniques
<em>
This study examines if inhabitants of different municipalities in Sweden are more harshly affected given an increase in gasoline tax. This is done by examining the demand elasticities and consumer surplus loss using a panel Error Correction Model. The results show that inhabitants of rural municipalities are more unresponsive and lose out more consumer surplus from a hypothetical increase in the tax. The loss is however so small that the tax can be considered basically proportional. The policy implication is that compensation for the benefit of rural inhabitants is unmotivated.
