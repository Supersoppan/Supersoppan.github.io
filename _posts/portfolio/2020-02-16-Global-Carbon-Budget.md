# Climate change - The global carbon budget

<em>The aim of this report is to use CO2 changes during the last 60 years and provide alternative estimates of the amount of anthropological carbon dioxide emission change in the atmosphere  until 2100. Our forecasts are then compared to data on RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. We see that both of  our  estimates  indicate  a  significant  increase  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere,  that exceeds CO2 concentration in 2100 nearly two times of the highest RPC estimate, i.e., RCP8.5.</em>
