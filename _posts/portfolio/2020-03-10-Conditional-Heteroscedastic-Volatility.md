# Replication of Tse - Conditional Heteroscedastic Volatility

<em>Tse, in his 1998 paper explores the conditional volatility (CV) of the USD/YEN exchange rate during the time period of 1978-1994. He carries out various (G)ARCH model settings concluding that there any asymmetry in CV of the exchange rate does not exist, additionally arguing that there are no significant differences between stable and fractionally integrated models. Later this paper is replicated and tested by Tsui and Ho (2004) arguing, that even though most of the findings generally match Tse’s (1998) results using USD/YEN exchange rate, exploring different currency pairs and using APARCH, FIAPARCH models indicates evidence of asymmetric CV. 
We find that our results are on par with Tse’s results, but if the time period of our sample increases, then our estimates are higher than Tse’s estimates. We also obtain asymmetry in the APARCH case for our sample, in line with Tsui and Ho’s (2004) who made a replication study of Tse.</em>
